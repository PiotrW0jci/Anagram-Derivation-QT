# Anagram-Derivation-QT
An anagram derivation is a N-letter word derived from a N-1 letter word by adding a letter and
rearranging. 
For example, here is a derivation of "aliens":

ail + s = sail + n = nails + e = aliens

Program  find the longest such derivation from a specific 3-letter word (one word
provided by user) in a list of words where every derived word also exists in the list of words.
words = {ail, tennis, nails, desk, aliens, table, engine, sail, etc....}

● fully working application - GUI

● can operate on external dictionary - text file where each line is
another word. User be able to choose the dictionary at runtime


● if there is more than 1 longest derivation (many words of the same length), the
application  it will show all.
